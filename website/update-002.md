Another two months, another update!

We’ve been busy and finally have something to show for it. Behold:

Okay, okay, don’t get too excited. **This is a working prototype**. I am sharing this with you only because we are friends, okay? 

In fact, it already has a few mistakes:

The whole shape of the thing will be different once we design our own board. Smaller. Maybe round? Hard to tell :) Meanwhile, we develop on those.

What are we developing? Well, it can measure light levels underneath. Notice the numbers in the console when background changes:

Okay, I have one more video to share. Our board of directors was meeting today and we recorded another demo:

YES it will be smaller. Relax. Size doesn’t always matter.

## Next steps

Prototype progress has set morale very high. Next steps include:

- ditch Fusion 360 for SolidWorks (if you know you know),
- get the device talking over USB, and
- develop a desktop app that will control it.

All in Rust, of course. So safe. So strongly typed.

Until soon,

# Late Mate — measure key-to-photon latency of anything. Yourself

Late Mate is a simple device that helps you measure latency between your keypresses and your monitor.

As easy as:

1. Plug into USB.
1. Put the other end at your screen.
1. Click Run.
1. Get your results in a nice-looking graph.

## We measure what matters

Testing components in isolation is great in theory, but in practice, what really matters is end-to-end latency, from keyboard to the screen. You press the button; how soon do you see a character appear?

We measure exactly that! Real numbers that represent what you actually feel and see, with all the internal overhead from OS/keyboard driver/app/screen accounted for (yes, there’s a lot of overhead!).

## No complicated setup required

Late Mate is just a light sensor with a USB cable. It doesn’t get simpler than that. Put it anywhere. Fix it anyhow. Works with any screen and any PC/Mac/laptop that has a USB port.

It’s also pretty easy to transport, in case you want to take this show on the road.

## Do I need this?

Yes.

Computer user? Find for yourself what the fastest text editor (or terminal, or browser, or messenger) is _for you_. Run tests on your own hardware, not some idealized setup in a lab.

Gamer? Figure out which settings give you the best reaction time. Learn how fast your monitor actually is on your specific hardware. Borderless or fullscreen? Does it even matter? Find it out for the game you are playing!

Developer building an app? Measure how long it takes for your app to react to user input. Maybe there’s unnecessary overhead you can get rid of? Your users will be happy. And you can attach nice-looking graphs, too.

## When?

We are currently finalizing hardware and software design. We expect shipping somewhere in 2024.
